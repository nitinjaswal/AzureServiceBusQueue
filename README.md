# Project Title 

This project demonstrates a simple sender and receiver implementation for Azure Service Bus Queue using .NET 8 and Blazor.  
It includes two main components:

- **sbreceiver**: Receives and processes messages from the Azure Service Bus Queue.

The solution is designed to help developers understand how to integrate Azure Service Bus messaging into Blazor applications.
